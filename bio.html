			My name is Kaiyuen Fong.  I am an international student from China currently working towards a Post-Bacc CS minor at Tufts University.  I have a Bachelor of Science degree in Applied Mathematics from Wentworth Institute of Technology in Boston Massachusetts.  I speak two languages Chinese and English.  My interest is how IT and Mathematics is applied in business and industry.  I have had two intership experiences.  I was a Manual Quality Assurence tester at Massachusetts Finantial Services, also known as MFS from mid 2015 - early 2016.  I'm also a research trainee at Umass Medical school's Horae Gene Therapy Center from 2017 to 2018.
